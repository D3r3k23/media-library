    summary: >-
      Director David Lynch's strange and visionary sci-fi epic is given a new lease of life with this unique fan-edit by Spicediver.
      Dune The Alternative Edition is a painstakingly created new cut that draws on the Theatrical Version (1984), the Extended Version (1988),
      various deleted scenes, and two versions of the original soundtrack album. Presented in 2.35 anamorphic widescreen with Dolby Digital 2.0 stereo sound.
